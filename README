TCLEPEG - README

tclepeg is an effort to bring epeg's functionality to TCL by means of a 
binary Linux library that can be loaded into a TCL program. epeg is a super-fast library for resizing JPEGs. It offers an improvement of at least an order of magnitude over other known image manipulation libraries. Epeg's source code can be found in the Enlightenment project: 

	http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/OLD/epeg/

COMPILE

Tclepeg depends on the existence of:

	libepeg 
	libjpeg

To compile tclepeg use:

	gcc -shared tclepeg.c -lepeg -ljpeg -o tclepeg.so

provided libepeg and libjpeg are installed on your system.

USAGE:

The tclepeg library provides a TCL command, epeg, that takes as an argument 
JPEG image data and produces a JPEG thumbnail.

Example usage:

	epeg -width 320 -height 240 -quality 50 $img

The following example reads a JPEG file and produces a thumbnail JPEG file:


	load ./tclepeg.so
	# read in a JPEG image
	set fd [open test.jpeg]
	fconfigure $fd -translation binary
	set img [read $fd]
	close $fd

	# write reduced image
	set fd [open out.jpeg w]
	fconfigure $fd -translation binary

	# let tclepeg do the work
	puts -nonewline $fd [epeg -width 320 -height 240 -quality 50 $img]

	close $fd
