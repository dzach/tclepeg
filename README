TCLEPEG - README

tclepeg is an effort to bring epeg's functionality to TCL by means of a 
binary Linux library that can be loaded into a TCL program. 

The tclepeg library provides a TCL command, epeg, that takes as an argument 
JPEG image data and produces a JPEG thumbnail.

The following example reads a JPEG file and produces a thumbnail JPEG file:


	load ./tclepeg.so
	# read in a JPEG image
	set fd [open test.jpeg]
	fconfigure $fd -translation binary
	set img [read $fd]
	close $fd

	# write reduced image
	set fd [open out.jpeg w]
	fconfigure $fd -translation binary

	# let tclepeg do the work
	puts -nonewline $fd [epeg -width 320 -height 240 -quality 50 $img]

	close $fd

COMPILE

Tclepeg depends on the existence of:

	libepeg 
	libjpeg

To compile tclepeg use:

	gcc -shared tclepeg.c -lepeg -ljpeg -o tclepeg.so

provided libepeg and libjpeg are installed on your system.
